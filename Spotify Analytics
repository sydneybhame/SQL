# For this project, I downloaded this Spotify dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/equinxx/spotify-top-50-songs-in-2021
# I then created a table using SQLite Studio and inserted the data into the table.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

# Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

# Data exploration using SQL:

# What is the average popularity, danceability, and energy of each artist?
SELECT artist_name,
    AVG(popularity),
    AVG(danceability),
    AVG(energy)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;

# Who are the Top 10 artists by popularity?
SELECT artist_name, 
  track_name, 
  popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10;

# What artist releast the longest song?
SELECT artist_name, 
  track_name, 
  MAX(duration_ms)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;

# What artist has the highest average danceability?
SELECT artist_name, 
  AVG(danceability)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
LIMIT 1;

# Finding out the average popularity for each artists, then, for every artist with an average popularity of 90 or above, showing their name, their average popularity, and labeling them as a “Top Star”.
WITH artist_popularity AS (
    SELECT s.artist_name AS artist, 
        AVG(s.popularity) AS pop
    FROM Spotifydata s
    GROUP BY artist
)
SELECT artist, 
    pop AS average_popularity,
    'Top Star' AS tag
FROM artist_popularity
WHERE average_popularity>=90;
